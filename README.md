This is a program that can be used as a game.
It shows the user the target needed to be acheived.
it asks the user to enter no of balls the algorithm takes to reach the target.
finally if we guess the right number it shows  0s,1s,2s,3s,4s,6s played in those balls and return if we guessed the right amount of balls.
remember guessing huge number will be unfair.
expected output :
1. your score
2. no of overs played
3. status of the game
4. won/lost by x runs
5. 0s,1s,2s,3s,4s,6s count
6. actual balls
